Gamified Waste Disposal with AI Verification & Dustbin Mapping
________________________________________
Project Overview:
BinGo is an AI-powered, gamified waste management platform that encourages responsible waste disposal by verifying real-world actions and rewarding users. It transforms civic responsibility into a fun and impactful experience‚Äîwhere users upload live proof of proper waste disposal, validated by AI, and earn points, badges, and rewards.
Beyond gamification, BinGo also solves real infrastructure gaps by allowing users to crowdsource the location of public dustbins‚Äîhelping others easily find the nearest disposal points using real-time maps and directions.

 Problems Solved:
‚Ä¢	Lack of individual accountability in waste behavior.
‚Ä¢	No reliable, verified system to reward eco-actions.
‚Ä¢	Difficulty locating public dustbins in real time.
‚Ä¢	No mechanism for authorities to track waste activity or hotspots.
‚Ä¢	Most apps lack action verification or engagement incentives.

 Key Features:
1. AI-Verified Waste Disposal
‚Ä¢	Users capture live disposal photos using their camera (uploads disabled).
‚Ä¢	Validation using:
o	Face Recognition (VGG-Face, OpenCV backend)
o	Fake Image Detection (CLIP + Custom prompt-based semantic comparison)
o	Duplicate Image Prevention (pHash + CLIP)
o	Dustbin/Waste Detection (YOLOv8n via ultralytics)
2. Gamification & Rewards
‚Ä¢	BinGo-missions, streaks, quizzes, and leaderboard rankings.
‚Ä¢	Rewards: Coupons, donation credits, and digital certificates.
3. Dustbin Mapping & Navigation üó∫Ô∏è
‚Ä¢	Users can pin new dustbin locations with GPS and image proof.
‚Ä¢	Others can view nearby dustbins and get directions, sorted by distance.
‚Ä¢	Enables a community-built map of waste disposal infrastructure.
4. Gemini-Powered AI Assistant
‚Ä¢	Chatbot answers eco-queries, suggests waste disposing methods, tell whether uploaded object is Biodegradable or not and much more.
